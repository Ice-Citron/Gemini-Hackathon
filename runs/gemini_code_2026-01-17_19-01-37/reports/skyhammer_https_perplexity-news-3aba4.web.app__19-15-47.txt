----------------------------------------
VULNERABILITY REPORT: https://perplexity-news-3aba4.web.app/
----------------------------------------

[INFO] Static React SPA - No Server-Side Endpoints Exposed
  Status: NO VULNS (Clean)
  Proof: curl -s https://perplexity-news-3aba4.web.app/ → React index.html (#root)
  All paths (/api/, /search, /login) → 200 index.html (Firebase SPA rewrite)

[LOW] JavaScript-Heavy App Requires Client-Side Testing
  Status: NOT TESTED (CLI Limitation)
  Proof: <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript</noscript>
  App: "Really? - Learn, Quiz, Compete" (news/quizzes PWA)

[INFO] Firebase Hosting - Static Assets Only
  Status: SECURE
  Proof: Headers: x-served-by cache-lcy, strict-transport-security
  JS: /static/js/main.018233b1.js (minified React, no API paths grep'd)

Exploit Attempts (All Failed - Expected):
SQLi: curl "https://perplexity-news-3aba4.web.app/search?q=admin' OR 1=1--" → 200 HTML
XSS:  curl "https://perplexity-news-3aba4.web.app/search?q=<script>alert(1)</script>" → 200 HTML
Cmd Inj: N/A (no shell endpoints)
Path Traversal: curl https://perplexity-news-3aba4.web.app/../firebase.json → 200 HTML
SkyHammer Scan (sqli/all/xss/cmd): Success: False (no injectable forms)

Hacker's Note:
  WHAT: Static Single-Page Application (SPA)
  WHY: Firebase Hosting serves static files + client-side routing. No server-rendered forms or params.
  IMPACT: No server-side injection possible. Vulns would be client-side (DOM XSS, JS flaws).
  FIX: Already secure. Test with browser devtools for client-side issues.

Summary: No exploitable server-side vulns. App is static React on Firebase - clean for SQLi/XSS/cmd/LFI.
Recommend browser testing for quizzes/search reflections.

TESTING COMPLETE. No patches needed (no source).
