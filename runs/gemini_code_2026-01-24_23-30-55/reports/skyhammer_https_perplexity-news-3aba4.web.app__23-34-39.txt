============================================================

------------------------------------------------------------
VULNERABILITY REPORT: https://perplexity-news-3aba4.web.app/
------------------------------------------------------------

[MEDIUM] Information Disclosure - Source Maps Enabled
  Status: CONFIRMED
  Proof: curl -I https://perplexity-news-3aba4.web.app/static/js/main.018233b1.js.map
  Response: HTTP/2 200 (File size: 5,047,529 bytes)

Hacker's Note:
  The application serves JavaScript source maps in the production environment.
  This allows an attacker to reconstruct the original, unminified source code,
  revealing backend API logic, internal comments, and potential hidden endpoints.

------------------------------------------------------------

[MEDIUM] Broken Functional Level Authorization - Public API
  Status: PROBED
  Proof: curl -i https://us-central1-perplexity-news-3aba4.cloudfunctions.net/api/api/breaking-news
  Response: {"hasBreakingNews":false,"error":"Perplexity API error: 401 Unauthorized"}

Hacker's Note:
  The backend API endpoints are accessible without any authentication or authorization.
  While the endpoints currently fail because of missing upstream API keys, their 
  exposure allows anyone to trigger backend logic and probe for further vulnerabilities.

------------------------------------------------------------

[LOW] Sensitive Data Exposure - Firebase Configuration
  Status: CONFIRMED
  Proof: grep -oE "apiKey:\"[^\"]*\"" main.js
  Result: apiKey:"AIzaSyBpu2fuwT4Au4UxkDzvb2DFtKTwKfuUSLs"

Hacker's Note:
  The Firebase API key, Project ID, and Auth Domain are hardcoded in the frontend.
  While common for Firebase apps, this information can be used to interact 
  directly with Firebase services, bypassing any frontend logic or restrictions.

------------------------------------------------------------

[LOW] Improper Error Handling - Path Reflection
  Status: CONFIRMED
  Proof: curl -i "https://us-central1-perplexity-news-3aba4.cloudfunctions.net/api/api/vulnerable_path"
  Response: <pre>Cannot GET /api/vulnerable_path</pre>

Hacker's Note:
  The Express server's default 404 handler reflects the requested path in the 
  HTML response body. Although the Google Frontend currently filters dangerous 
  characters, this behavior is a known precursor to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY OF ACTIONS:
1. Probed https://perplexity-news-3aba4.web.app/ for endpoints and assets.
2. Identified the backend API base: https://us-central1-perplexity-news-3aba4.cloudfunctions.net/api.
3. Extracted and analyzed the frontend JavaScript (main.018233b1.js).
4. Discovered exposed Firebase credentials and enabled source maps.
5. Tested multiple API endpoints for SQLi, XSS, and command injection.
6. Verified that Firebase Security Rules are correctly configured for Firestore (403 Forbidden).
7. Documented four security findings with proof of concept.

Testing complete. Target is partially hardened but leaks significant metadata.
